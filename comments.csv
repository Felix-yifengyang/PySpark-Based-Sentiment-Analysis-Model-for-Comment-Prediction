"*SOME PEOPLE STILL ASK, ""WHY ARE THERE STILL APES (OR MONKEYS)?""*
It should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works. Apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes, and from that, due to their lack of education, they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans. That is not how evolution works, but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology. 

They might just as well have asked ""If dogs are descended from wolves, why are there still wolves?"" Or even ""If Americans came from Europe, why are there still Europeans?"" Just as dogs descended from a population of wolves, so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes. 

What we know is that the first apes evolved in Africa about 25 million years ago from a population of Old World Monkeys. Whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the TOPS of branches, apes evolved the ability to swing, arm over arm, from branch to branch. Evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment. For apes, that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it. At one time there were about 30 different  species of apes in those forests.

Had environmental conditions remained the same, we would still see forests covering the whole African continent. However, conditions did not stay the same; the climate became drier. As a result, forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands, the African savanna, with just a few scattered trees. The shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct.

Then, about 6 or 7 million years ago, one population of apes split, with some of them opting for life on that open savanna. All apes are capable of walking upright, they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time.  Recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them, walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking. Chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly.

That savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity. by about 4 mya, our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis, femur, knees and feet as modern humans. That gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel. They did however, retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened.

The apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change. They became the ancestors of today's chimps and bonobos. Those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes, and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them. It set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us.",0

"After the foul taste the original GoT left in my mouth, I didn't have very high hopes for this. Yet I watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons, maybe not quite there yet, but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it.

I find it hard to pinpoint Daemon, on the one hand he wants to show strength (the city watch part), but then he's also arrogant (the tournament, claiming victory while the fight wasn't over) and straight up horrible (heir for a day?). But on the other hand, he really cares for Rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her, her father would need him more now than ever before, which shows he also cares for Viserys. I think him calling Viserys weak, was his blunt way of telling Viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king, which is in line with what he did with the city watch, he feels like the king should show his strength.

Viserys seems like he's held things together for those 9 years, but this clearly is coming to an end, I feel like he's made a huge mistake by alienating Daemon, this won't make things easy for Rhaenyra, who already has to fight the fact that some people don't want a woman on the throne.

"My theory here:

- That ""plant creature"" could possibly be that Fungus but in a more mutated form. As seen previously in the ""Missing Persons"" and  ""Autopsy Report"" videos, whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, they get covered in this black coloured fungus. This fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto (mutating itself onto the dead body). Given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate (100, 1000 or even millions of years at best) and also given that how time passes strangely in the Backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the ""Informational"" video with the date 2/9/1990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished, however it wasn't teleportation but instead time travel. That researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the ""Presentation"" video with the date 5/8/1990 when the alarm rang out and CCTV footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by Async. So by this logic, the whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time. The creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash. As seen in Kane's secret video of ""9780415263573"", this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed, the driver wasn't able to push the brakes in time to stop the car. Thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage. The driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there. The fungus grew on him and later the entire room in it's mutated form. Also it sounded like the creature was yelling out ""Help"" in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room (which was seen in the ""original found footage"" video and later the ""Pitfalls"" video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of it's last victims and in this case, even it's originator which is the driver). It's all just a theory which I just came up with. Don't take it canon lol.",0

But for anyone out there who have worries or anxieties for their next few years, just know that if I could make it, than so can you. I hope you will get to experience the same bliss I have at the moment. As we often forget to enjoy just today, when we keep thinking about the tomorrows

And thank you ChilledCow, for being there during the moments

Edit: I just want to say I appreciate everyone for all the encouraging likes and messages. I wish nothing but the best for all of you who are pulling through your struggles",0

Just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of high-skill tools (say photoshop) really well to even modify a picture or video.  These days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to Instagram or Tiktok.  Did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct? No.  But it does mean that you need to be REALLY GOOD to be able to survive as a graphic designer.  I see the same future for data science field too.  Maybe not tomorrow, but the trend is coming for sure.

The correct order of working for Neural Network with explanation: 
B. The weighted sum of inputs is calculated
A. The Bias is added
D. The result is fed to an activation function
C. Specific Neuron is activated

Explanation: In a neural network, each neuron in one layer is connected to other neurons in the corresponding layers. These connections carry random weights. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated, and an additional input in the form of bias is added (w * x + b). The result of this is fed to an activation function. Based on a particular threshold value, only those neurons get activated that crosses the threshold value.

We are pleased to announce the 3 lucky winners who got the right answer for our quiz:

"The universe is fractal, therefore the same rules that apply to a solar system must apply to an atom (except at faster speeds), otherwise the universe would collapse in disarray and conflict. Empirical observations of the micro universe are as good as the equipment utilized to collect them. If one observes a particle (planet) around the nucleus (sun) with a shutter speed equal to one revolution, it would register at one position only; 1/2 cycle would result in two opposite positions. At higher speeds more positions are collected and the vibration (wave) function starts to reveal itself. What is missing in our science at the particle level is the inclusion of the interaction between the particle and the energy dissipated from the device used to observe it (equipment or human brain).",1

"Excellent repair.  

I few years back, I did a repair on a computer with a broken SATA port.  i replaced the port and the system ran fine.  A year and a half later the same customer comes in saying that his data storage hard drive wasn't working.  I'm like 'okay'.  I asked did he want data recover service.  He said it was working fine and that I was the last person to touch the computer so it must have been something I'd done.  I keep snap shots of before and after repairs of my work and keep a printout with all my work orders.  I said to him that his system didn't even have an HDD in it when it was repaired and only had one SSD in it.  He mumbled something and said he'd just take his business elsewhere.

I know the vast majority of people reading this are either in the electronics repair business or are hobbyists.  But I have a serious question to people who'd just be regular customers.  If you had something repaired a year or more ago and something else went wrong unrelated to the original problem, would you seriously bring it back to the repair shop expecting that it would get fixed for free?  I'm hoping this question doesn't come out as snarky or sarcastic.  It's a sincere question I'd like to have answered.",1

In this game it's actually one open world so it's the largest open space of any game they created. And they did say that this open world is bigger than Prey.,1

That would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light. In effect, just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving it's structure idle, at its point of origin, but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parent's original quality. In this accomplishing the  quantum speeds. Said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement, pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction, as well as color change. We see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic  plant cells. Great  discussion.",2

I think you would be intrigued  to hear or perhaps you are already aware  that there is an ancient  record that was unearthed in the 1820's in Palmyra,  New York that was inscribed  in reformed Egyptian by ancient  Israelites. They crossed over the seas from Jerusalem around 600 BC and landed on what they described to be  a narrow neck of land (most likely in Panama). They left their records behind for us and their records spoke of Jesus Christ visiting them after his resurrection.  They multiplied their seed and spread North and South and fought many battles over the  North and South American continents which were considered their new ""Promised land"".  Thus the signs of Christ written with Hebrew origin that you examined would be accurate. There is another record which has been discovered in Panama much like the one discovered in Palmyra, New York. It is a gold set of plates with ancient Egyptian and Hebrew origins as well. Perhaps you could examin the Panama gold plates to see if they are authentic?",2

"This actually worked really well for me! The first time I tried it it took me awhile but I got to the last step, then messed it up. But, I realized it was still partially solved somehow, except the yellow was the one that was solved and the white was broken up. I just redid the last few steps with the cube upside-down (yellow on the bottom and white on the top) and it worked! Thanks for this wonderful tutorial, this was my first time solving a Rubik's cube!!",2

I have been wanting to make my own devlog series but I was not able to stick to a project long enough. Till now, I have been wanting to make devlogs and work on a small project for a timeline of 3 months. And just finish a full game. 
Any tips to just stick to it?",2

"Imagine this:
You wake up in a room that you've never seen before. The bed you're lying in is very comfortable. You sink right into it. You don't want to leave, but you want to know where you are. You sit up, and looking around the room, you see that it looks like you're in a very cozy, but very old room. This room has seen many, many things, it seems. There's a mirror to use, in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice. There is a closet full of clothes, however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you. If you prefer the feminine choice, it is a beautiful seafoam green dress, with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees, grouped with black mary janes and long, white socks. The masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas, with black dress shoes. You put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room. You go down the stairs of the house to find two people. They look like blonde twins. One is a boy, the other is a girl. They are sipping their tea when one of them notices you. 
""Oh! You're awake!"" The boy cries. ""So they are!"" The girl replies. They introduce themselves as Aaron and Anastasia. Aaron tells you that, since you've been asleep all morning, it would be good for you to go outside with them. You reluctantly agree, but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside. You see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves. There are mountains in the distance, and you can also see a nice pond. In the sky, you can see the moons, and even a planet or two. You can even faintly see the stars. There are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings. The three of you walk up to that tree, and you spend the rest of the day playing there, the twins took turns pushing you on the swing. Eventually, night came, and you went back to the house for dinner. Anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta you'd ever had, and Aaron did the dishes, insisting that you relax as their guest. After a little while, you retired to your bedroom, changed into the clothes given to you, and succumbed to a calm, dreamers sleep, wondering what the next day had in store for you...",2

"John Romero used to say that the first level in the game was the last level he designed. 
By that time, you already know what the whole game is going to play like, and you can use that knowledge to weave it all together seamlessly. 
It works perfectly for somewhat simple games like Commander Keen and DOOM, and I'd like to think that it still works for more advanced or narrative-driven games.

Thoughts?",2
This is really a good video for starters in machine learning. Thank You for it. It would be really helpful if you could share the datasets used in the examples for self-practice.

Do traders convert BTC into a stablecoin when they feel the price is high and wait until the price drops down and ""buy back"" by converting back into BTC? is this what people do? also would convertions into different cryptos be classed as a selling it for tax purposes? thank you for any advice, all the best, Kieron",2

For example she asks ""Which one would you like?"" then she says ""Okay perfect"" and no matter what someone picks, it seems really interactive. Also love the attention to detail with the airplane cups! :) Thanks so much for the relaxation and content you provide for us <3",2
"You did a great job introducing the ""how to learn"" aspect of what I think stumps a lot of intimidated curious learners. Basically, when you explained ""When I saw this I didn't know what it meant, so I googled it."" That is crazily enough, a big lesson to learn.  Just hearing that at least is encouraging me to take my first independent steps to learning this stuff.  So of course, thanks for the video!",2

"So I took the SAT practice test 10 right... I usually score 1360-1400 on a practice test. I make a total of 5 mistakes on the math section on a bad day, which is what happend. Usually it will translate to a score of 730-740. I did pretty well on reading (33/52) and writing (40/44) sections. I'm excited to calculate my score and then... I see the horrific truth:
40/44 in writing is translated to 330 (70 points deducted for 4 wrong answers).
33/52 is translated to 280 (Fine).
53/58 is translated to 710 (90 points deducted for 5 wrong answers). 
A total of 1320. Even though I did exteramly good in the writing section, just above averge in reading (which is a totally flawed section but that's another topic), and amazing in the math section I got a just above average score that gives me no chance hypothetically to get into my dream school.

The most surprising thing for me is that I have always been interested in AI but did not know what computer science classes to take to follow this through.

"I love the original Tamil movie. The Tamil version solidified Vijay Sethupathy as my favorite actor. The whole concept of setting up the story in the Vikram Vetal backdrop was so unique. The climax fight- Vedha has a 'come what may'/ unhinged/ chaotic attitude- and the crazy banter between Vikram and Vedha during the fight .. it was absolutely fresh to look at... Personally I love both Saif and Hrithik. I really don't want to compare VJS and Hrithik. I'll be honest, I was skeptical about the remake. But the teaser does look promising. I love Hrithik's attempt at being the unhinged 'Vedha'. Except for the accent, as you rightly pointed out, the teaser does look promising. Even though the bgm is very good, I was just hearing the bgm from the original in my head! I do miss it... I really really really hope and pray this movie does well...",2

"On the first point: I had been coding since 7th grade and I had plenty of classmates who hadn't coded ever when I started college. For those of you in the latter position, we don't judge your for not knowing programming. We are glad you are trying to learn and many of us want to help you! I love inviting friends over to my dorm and helping them out with assignments and group studying. You don't need to be scared of us or embarrassed that you aren't a flawless coder, we aren't either and the skill we have we had to put in work for as well, and we want to help you get to that point as well! We're all at school to learn, and if I can help others I will, I hope once I get to upper division classes that those friends will help me as well when they inevitably get to a point where they are better than me at certain things! You can't be the best at everything

Also for the book thing, as a math major (double majoring), I have a nagging need to buy every book for every class. They are expensive, but it fills me with pure joy to have a library of math and CS textbooks in my room. I am willing to skip on a game or two for a textbook, both provide me with entertainment because I am weird lol",2

Be a teacher but forever a student. Listening in itself is a lost art. So difficult to run across a good listener. Joe Rogan comes to mind. I really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with Elon as his guest. I don't necessarily agree with Elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts. What I like about Joe is he gives his guest's time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs ( or agenda like so many on the tell a vision).  Being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort.,2
this person is a legend over 6 years on yt and has made teachers feel like peasants cuz this guy is the man for math he has rlly taught me and made me pass countless tests i am sooo thankful thanks,2

"CS requires a person who is patient, persistent, creative in solutions... Basically not someone who sees a wall and says i am done. That's how you can know. Further as you grow into CS you will find out that you have been taught how to solve any problem, even if not from this field: think, research, learn, craft. Every experience that you go through will you improve at those steps. You will graduatelly stumble across moments where you will be overwhelmed, and it's ok, because you also learn that progress is through error after error, only for the new problem to come to you, and apply the same process; you already can handle being overwhelmed.",2
It proves that everything is interesting if it is taught in the right way,2

Being a trade professional such as plumbing or HVAC can be VERY lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years. If you can become the name that people automatically think of for HVAC problems - you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you. You can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire - with a tech school diploma - you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service.,2

It is a beautiful game, rich with stunningly creative ideas and tactics. It has stood the test of time because each generation realizes in greater depth than the previous one, how many more things are possible in a game, how far ahead can pieces support each other, how deep and far-seeing ideas can be, and how rich a battlefield it is to display the full range of human cleverness and emotions.",2

"It was around the summer of 1974 when a friend and I went to the Fresno Zoo. As we approached the hippo area we could see one in the water. We watched it for a little while then started to walk away when suddenly this little baby hippo head broke the surface of the water. Needless to say, we were captivated by this tiny baby hippo that was frolicking in the water around its mother. We could hardly tear our eyes away from the delightful sight. Later that night  the local news show had a report about the new baby hippo that had just been born at the Zoo that day. That baby hippo was one of the most adorable baby animals I've ever seen!",2

"I have a masters of data science but once I started working in a data position, I have realized that I enjoy more of the coding and building. Whether its writing Python, SQL, or R code for building and analyzing data, or building reports in SSRS, those are the aspects of my job that I most enjoy. I have been considering changing careers to software engineering. Also, I do feel like data scientists are expected to know too much these days. From communication, data visualization, statistics and deep learning, to cloud platforms, Spark and now Docker. That is a ton of skill and knowledge that seems super-human!",2

"Thanks for the review, i can't wait for your full review!

My dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this:  42 inches or so, anti-glare, normal aspect ratio not ultra wide, but 1440 @ 200mhz instead of 4k (because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k @ 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway).

If possible, i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review:

- What do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor (try playing a game in 1080/1440 and seeing what the monitor's scaling is like)
- In the settings, what HDR options are available?

Thanks!",2

"One of my favorite cakes my mother ever made started out as a near fail. It was a cheesecake that had cracked down the middle. We had blueberries growing in our yard, so she took a bunch that we'd already picked, cooked them down into a thick jelly, and poured it into the crack. As I recall, she called it ""Grand Canyon Blueberry Cheesecake.""",2

"I've been listening to this guy's speeches all day and it just resonates with me more than anything I have seen in a long time. I was misdiagnosed with adhd in elementary school (this wonderful psychologist actually told me in 5th grade that it was a misdiagnosis so I know). So I spent 5 years believing I had adhd when all I had was this thing called childhood. Eventually in 10th grade I switched to an alternative school and everything Robinson has said regarding alternative schools in his other speeches is spot on. I'm a senior at my alternative school, going to college next year and this school has had a profound impact on me. I'll spare the details, but I just want to confirm that alternative schools are very often the solution and right now what I'm most passionate about is making this education revolution happen and I will do everything in my power to achieve this. I wouldn't have this passion if it were not for my alternative school experience, which inspired learning instead of forcing conformity. 

Much thanks to Ken Robinson for his words of wisdom and innspiration andsharing his vision with us.

I did the exercise consisting to predict the prices of the house from th 'boston housing' dataset. It works as explained in the video. I just have few questions concerning the training, test and prediction. Indeed, what guide the  right choice of the train/test_size and random_state values? In my code I changed the test_size value to 0.5 and the random_state to 7, I got a nice prediction for arrays [3] & [5] but not for array[9] for example! And when I compute the mean squared value, I get 33.36. Can such a value be acceptable? Thank you again for all.",2

I have been an Android user for 10 plus years and especially with Samsung devices the OS system has drastically improved. I went from a Galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip. I would get the occasional hiccups but I might be able to reason that the covid pandemic kind of slow development down just like it has with a lot of other things but other than that seems like my phone is getting better and better with each monthly update.,2

Haven't seen a Newcastle side play that well (against Man City no less) in a very long time. 

Gutted but grateful to get a point in the end.  Just a heroic team performance. Could single every player in the starting XI out for praise.  Just so proud of all of them.

As for City, I'll just say I clapped as soon as I saw De Bruyne had played Silva in on goal.  Just phenomenal football.  I mean, at times during that match, it was terrifying when City had possession.  A wonderful side and a wonderful manager.",2

The Simpson flip really is incredible.  Looks like something you'd see in a movie about someone gaining super powers and taking advantage of it by playing football.,2
Jimmy you are doing everything (and much more) that I've always wanted and helping people in such an amazing capacity. May God keep blessing you. I love watching you do this because I probably will never get to,2
"Randomly saw this video on my feed. Like the vibe, nice and relaxing and this is the type of makeup I do on myself. Super hydrating, glowy and minimal.",2
Awesome show as always!,2
Such a nice guy. makes it so we dont have to suffer from messy set ups. and even let us have the first bite : D,2

"The best, most exciting, most practical, most fascinating Ted talk that I continue to come back to you again and again. Read the book multiple times, applied it to everything from learning a new language to fixing up my house, to now developing my skills as a ham radio operator. Thank you so much for this.",2

"My doctor also told me that our ears are self-cleaning. But when I pressured her for some off-the-record advice, she finally conceded that if I really.. REALLY.. felt the need to clean inside my ear canal, I could go ahead and use my elbows. I just adore my doctor!",2
"Great advice on typing out other people's work. Myself as a beginner it's easy to get flustered on projects as some solutions/tools I have not yet been exposed to. By looking up other's solutions/work and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code. Furthermore, sometimes the solutions don't work as I am using python 3.10 and so I have to work out and start fishing around for the latest 'iteration' of the module/code and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge.",2
"I love the end where he pays the mom a lot if money, she looked so happy.",2
Proud of you Bestie!,2
It was a good introductory course! Although there's lack of examples in the explanation of neural network part. But overall you can get the idea of how deep learning works.,2
"The first minute of the video is almost the same explanation that was given to us by our professor in literature when I was in college. The rest of it is an expansion of what I already know and at some point, I came to realize that there are more things that I haven't stumbled upon before in the introduction of lit. 

Thanks a lot and I hope you produce more content for both language and literature subjects",2
This isn't just a western. It's a documentary based on Goodnight and Loving and their trail drives. But absolutely classic of classics. Duvall said it was his favorite film to play in.,2
"Hi,

Great video really gave some helpful insights, I'm currently in university studying computer science as every single company in my city said its a requirement, but I'm also going to be working on  my own projects hopefully I can skip the stage of being employed and start my own company, we can dream haha, but yeah this has been helpful, the information was concise and well presented, good job and thank you",2
"I really like the path this game is going towards, the world looks and feels alive yet captivatingly out of this world. I would love to help you in a way, English and Turkish are my primary languages, so you can reach to me if you need any translation work to Turkish in the future, since that's all I can do :))",2

"At 2:24, Elon says something quite profound. 

""Entrepreneurs are born of everyday"". This resonates with me because the next big entrepreneurs are likely to be ordinary people, with an innovative idea and a solution to a problem that people face everyday. They are problem solvers. It's quite exciting to see fresh new ideas come to market and people starting new businesses.",2
"What Hamza said about being careful about momentous emotional self improvement decisions driven by motivation really hits home for me. 
Fallen off the wagon on no fap, drinking, diets etc because of it in the not too distant past.

"They shouldn't have a cut scene after the phone ring I'm ready for it to amp up. 36 in and I'm thinking of switching. I like the screen composition the actors and the lack of music. Maybe a few more minutes. 

Edit: it picks up after the flashback. If the flashback was just for a second after Dallas asks the pacing is actually pretty solid.

Mack and Dallas are amazing actors. I love their first scene and Dallas and his wife in the kitchen.",2
"As a goth, I wear cool-toned makeup often, especially on the eyes. But I totally get why not everybody loves it! I want to say that the lips looks beautiful on you!",2

These guys are nicer than the average German these days haha,2
"Luxury fashion is one of the world's biggest industries. I think this is a great topic for a Bloomberg series. I would be interested is seeing more of this type of content. I am particularly interested in the recent collaboration between Gucci and Balenciaga, especially now that I know they both come under the Kering umbrella. Other recent collaborations include Versace and Fendi, which could be the subject of another video. The more recent video in this series examines the Chinese market, and how fashion brands are now targeting young Asian consumers.",2

"I never thought I could learn or understood physics problems but I must confess that you've changed that, now I am working physics problems and I have also been able to applied your method to other problems and I am doing it.

"I remember seeing your first devlog 2 years ago and just knowing it wasn't going to be another one of those indie games that devs drop after a few months and boy was i right. I haven't seen a more polished amazing looking well thought out fun indie game in my entire life and i don't think i will ever see anything like this again. If i was you i would be extremely proud of myself for making something as cool as this and same goes to everyone who helped you. I cannot wait to be able to play this but i cant even wait to see these dev logs at the end of each month. Awesome work keep it up and best of luck!

17:40 Also i think these humanoid characters will really go far in this game even if they arent enemies, and no matter how hard they are to animate i really think its going to make your game stand out from traditional indie games as if it doesn't enough! Also to whoever concepted the humanoid characters awesome job! Looks dope!",2
